Hey! Here’s everything you need to know about the Livetran REST API. It’s designed to be simple and predictable.

All endpoints are relative to your base URL and live under the `/api/` prefix. Remember to include your `LT-SIGNATURE` header for POST requests!

---

### POST `/start-stream`
This endpoint kicks off a new stream. You'll need to provide a `stream_id` and optionally some webhook URLs to get status updates.

<Card title="Example Request Body">
```json
{
  "stream_id": "your-unique-stream-id",
  "webhook_urls": [
    "https://your-server.com/livetran-updates"
  ]
}
```
</Card>

---

### POST `/stop-stream`
Use this to stop a stream that's currently in progress. All you need is the `stream_id`.

<Card title="Example Request Body">
```json
{
  "stream_id": "your-unique-stream-id"
}
```
</Card>

---

### POST `/status`
Want to check if a stream is live? Hit this endpoint with the `stream_id`.

<Card title="Example Request Body">
```json
{
  "stream_id": "your-unique-stream-id"
}
```
</Card>

### GET `/video/{stream_id}/{file}`
This isn't a typical REST endpoint, but it's how you'll get the actual video files. You can fetch the HLS playlist (`.m3u8`) and video segments (`.ts`) using this path.

**Example URL:** `/video/your-unique-stream-id/playlist.m3u8`
