## Running Livetran with Docker

I've included a `Dockerfile` in the project to make it super easy to get Livetran up and running in a container. This is the recommended way to deploy the application in production.

### Building the Image

First, you'll need to build the Docker image. Open up a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t livetran .
```

This will create a new Docker image with the tag `livetran`.

### Running the Container

Once the image is built, you can start a container with this command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name livetran-server livetran
```

This will start the Livetran server in a detached container and map port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container.

### A Note on `.env` and Keys

The `Dockerfile` is set up to copy your `.env` file and the contents of the `keys` directory into the image. Make sure you have these set up correctly before building the image, especially for a production environment.
