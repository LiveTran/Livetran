## From Your Server to the World

Okay, so FFmpeg is busy creating all your HLS files. Now what? We need to get them to your viewers, and that's where Cloudflare R2 comes in.

### The R2 Uploader

I've built a little helper that's dedicated to one job: getting your video files to R2 as fast as possible. It's configured to talk directly to your R2 bucket, so you don't have to worry about the details.

  **I'm Watching You, Files...**

  The uploader uses a library called `fsnotify` to keep an eye on the output directory. The moment FFmpeg writes a new `.m3u8` or `.ts` file, the uploader sees it and immediately starts uploading it to R2. It's like having a little robot that's constantly making sure your stream is up-to-date for your viewers.
